People like web interfaces for some reason. 

So you wanna change the default routing scheme

You COULD do it via the web interface, changing the babel configuration
changing he network interfaces, by clicking on a lot of stuff, ahcp,
etc...

OR you could just login to the router and, assuming X.Y is your new address...

sed -i 's/30.42/X.Y/gp' /etc/config/*; reboot; exit

Your choice.
