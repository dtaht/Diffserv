tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: multiq

57	The qdisc will allocate the number of bands to equal the number of queues that
58	the device reports, and bring the qdisc online.  Assuming eth0 has 4 Tx
59	queues, the band mapping would look like:
60	
61	band 0 => queue 0
62	band 1 => queue 1
63	band 2 => queue 2
64	band 3 => queue 3
65	
66	Traffic will begin flowing through each queue based on either the simple_tx_hash
67	function or based on netdev->select_queue() if you have it defined.
68	
69	The behavior of tc filters remains the same.  However a new tc action,
70	skbedit, has been added.  Assuming you wanted to route all traffic to a
71	specific host, for example 192.168.0.3, through a specific queue you could use
72	this action and establish a filter such as:
73	
74	tc filter add dev eth0 parent 1: protocol ip prio 1 u32 \
75		match ip dst 192.168.0.3 \
76		action skbedit queue_mapping 3
